    <p id="secretText" style="display:none;">I wish I could write a poem <br>
      Just like the one I sent you <br>
      Or even similar to Rob's <br>
      But I am not the writer I thought I would become in year 6 <br>
      So I cannot adequately describe <br>
      How pretty you look when you smile <br>
      Or the laugh that brightens the room <br>
      <br>
      Nothing beats the aura of contentment <br>
        when you're drinking your morning coffee <br>
        Or the passion in your voice when discussing Taylor <br>
        I could go on but this is an attempt at a poem, not an essay <br>
      <br>
        As always, <br>
        If I can make you as happy as you make me, <br>
        Then we'll both be alright. <br>
        <br>
        Happy Birthday Evie <br>
        I love you. <br>
        <br>
        - Written the night before I fly to Portugal <br>
        I should be asleep, but I miss you.
